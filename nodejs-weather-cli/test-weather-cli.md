# Weather CLI

This is a simple command-line interface (CLI) built using Node.js that allows you to fetch current weather information for any city using the **wttr.in** service. No API key or sign-up is required.

## Prerequisites

  You can check if Node.js is installed by running:

  node -v
  ```
