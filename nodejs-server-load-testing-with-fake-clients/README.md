This kind of setup is useful for measuring latency and simulating load under controlled conditions, especially when you're developing or load-testing a server.

üîç What This Is Useful For:

1. Measuring Server Latency
   You're sending the client's current time and comparing it to the server's time on receipt. This lets you:

Measure how long it took the request to reach the server (serverDelta).

Measure total round-trip time (Client RTT) including server processing + response time.

This is helpful when:

Testing network delay (though on localhost this is minimal).

Checking if your server's response slows down under load.

2. Load Testing and Benchmarking
   You're creating multiple fake clients (via loops or tools) with different IPs:

Simulates many users hitting your server.

Lets you see if performance degrades with higher load.

Helps you identify bottlenecks or performance regressions.

3. Monitoring and Alerts
   This same mechanism can be adapted in production:

Clients can include their local timestamp.

Server logs serverDelta, alerting you if network or server latency suddenly increases.

4. Testing Server Time Drift
   If clients and servers are in different time zones or systems with unsynced clocks, this helps detect drift or inconsistencies.

üö´ What It‚Äôs Not Good For:
It won't simulate real internet latency since it's local.

You can't get real IP-level spoofing ‚Äî it's simulated via headers.

It doesn't test TLS, CDN, or production firewalls.
